# CS_Architect_Lab

### I’ve been working on something I wish existed when I was learning Computer Science.

Architect Labs is an interactive visualization project that explains core CS fundamentals —
from bits on the wire to memory in the heap.

Instead of slides or long theory, concepts are shown visually and step-by-step.

Current modules include:

## 🧠 Module 1: Computer Networking
• OSI Model – data encapsulation & decapsulation
• TCP 3-Way Handshake – SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK
• Sliding Window – flow control & pipelining
• IP Subnetting – binary masks & address division
• Routing & Packet Switching – hop-by-hop packet flow

## 🧩 Module 2: C & Memory Architecture
• Pointers & Memory Map – addresses vs values
• Structs & Alignment – padding & CPU alignment
• Heap, malloc & memory leaks – dynamic allocation
• Buffer Overflow – stack overwrite & crash simulation

This is not a course.
No certificates.
No shortcuts.

Just interactive mental models for understanding how systems actually work.

Still evolving — feedback from engineers, students, and educators is welcome.
